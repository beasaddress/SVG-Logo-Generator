## Description
This project generates a SVG Logo straight from Git Bash. A user will pull up the application on Git, run "node index.js" and will be asked a series of questions that will become the characteristics of their logo. The user can pick the shape of their logo, the color, the text, and the text color. This saves time because the user will not have to pay for a logo from a professional designer because they can make one using this app. Here is a link to the walkthrough video: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hVFmWlxTCrzM3H3qWvR3pJ8qjiwCPkkJ/view
